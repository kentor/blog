          I'm Kenneth. I'm a software engineer specializing in front-end
          engineering and currently working
          at <a href="http://www.rescale.com/">Rescale</a>.
          I have deep interests in architecturing simple and scalable systems,
          with a focus on developer experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My programming philosophies:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
          Do not sacrifice greppability for the sake of being DRY.
        </em></blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>
          It is okay to repeat yourself until you've found a good abstraction.
        </em></blockquote>
        <p>
          These are the talks and articles that have inspired me the most as a
          programmer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {talks.map(talk =>
            <li key={talk.name}>
              <a href={talk.url}>{talk.name}</a> â€“ {talk.author}
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      </article>

          This site is statically generated using React and Node.js, and hosted
          on <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>. I wrote my own static
          site generator with live reloading. The source can be
